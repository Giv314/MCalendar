# MCalendar
Messaging calendar
App developed (actually still in development) for helping people to find messages sent in a specific day through WhatsApp Messenger.
- How to use:
1. Create a person through plus button
2. Export Messages from WhatsApp (for now you need to use MixPlorer to convert to .txt but I'll try to fix it soon)
3. Click on the person you've created and you'll be able to access the exported messages
4. (Soon) After making steps 1 and 2, you can set a day through the calendar and the app will show you the messages you've sent at that day
That's it :D

(It's basically a project for my college's technological event)
